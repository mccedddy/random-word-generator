# Random Word Generator #
This is a simple web-based tool that generates random words. The words are fetched from random word API, and each generated word has its definition retrieved from a definition API. Additionally, each generated word can be automatically copied to the clipboard.

I created this project to generate random words for a macro script I was working on, and it also served as practice for using APIs, JavaScript testing frameworks, and the CSS pre-processor SASS.
